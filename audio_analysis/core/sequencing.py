Song Sequence Recommendation Module

This module implements intelligent song sequencing algorithms designed specifically
for synthesizer music. The approach combines music theory principles with practical
DJ/playlist creation knowledge to generate optimal listening sequences.

The analytical approach is based on several key principles:
1. Musical flow: Songs should transition smoothly based on key, tempo, and energy
2. Emotional journey: The sequence should tell a coherent emotional story
3. Compositional balance: Avoid monotony while maintaining cohesion
4. Creative intent: Support the artistic vision of the composer/curator

Key Concepts:
- Transition scoring: Quantifies how well two songs flow together
- Musical compatibility: Uses music theory to assess harmonic relationships
- Energy arc: Creates dynamic progression through the listening experience
- Mood coherence: Ensures emotional consistency while allowing for evolution

The algorithm is particularly effective for:
- Album sequencing for electronic music releases
- DJ set preparation and flow optimization
- Playlist creation for different moods and contexts
- Understanding compositional relationships in a body of work
