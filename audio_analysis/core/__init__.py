"""
Core analysis modules for audio feature extraction and processing.

This package contains the fundamental audio analysis algorithms that power
the synthesizer music analysis toolkit. Each module focuses on a specific
aspect of audio understanding relevant to creative music production.

Modules:
- feature_extraction: Extract comprehensive audio features using librosa
- phase_detection: Detect musical phases/sections in long-form compositions
- clustering: Group similar tracks using K-means on extracted features
- sequencing: Generate optimal listening sequences using musical flow principles
