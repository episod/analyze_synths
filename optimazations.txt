> How can we ensure the analytical aspect of this app would scale to Tenstorrent 
  processors? (Just explain, don't do the work yet!)

⏺ Looking at the audio analysis toolkit, scaling to Tenstorrent processors would
  involve several key considerations:

  Hardware-Specific Optimizations

  Tensor Operations: The current NumPy/SciPy operations (spectral analysis,
  clustering, FFTs) could be rewritten using Tenstorrent's tensor processing
  units. Features like MFCC extraction, spectral rolloff, and clustering
  algorithms would benefit from parallel tensor operations.

  Memory Architecture: Tenstorrent's distributed memory model would require
  restructuring how audio features are processed. Instead of loading entire audio
   files into memory, we'd need to stream and process audio in chunks that fit
  the processor's memory hierarchy.

  Algorithmic Adaptations

  Batch Processing: The current sequential file processing could be parallelized
  to process multiple audio files simultaneously across Tenstorrent's cores. The
  80+ feature extraction pipeline is naturally parallelizable.

  Clustering Optimization: K-means clustering could leverage Tenstorrent's matrix
   multiplication capabilities for distance calculations and centroid updates,
  significantly speeding up the similarity grouping process.

  Data Pipeline Restructuring

  Streaming Architecture: Rather than the current batch processing model, we'd
  implement a streaming pipeline where audio analysis happens in real-time as
  data flows through the processor's fabric.

  Feature Standardization: The current standardization step could be distributed
  across cores, with each core handling specific feature types (spectral,
  temporal, harmonic).

  Framework Integration

  TT-NN Integration: The core analysis algorithms would need to be rewritten
  using Tenstorrent's neural network framework, particularly for the mood and
  character analysis components that use threshold-based classification.

  Custom Kernels: Performance-critical operations like phase detection and
  spectral analysis might benefit from custom Tenstorrent kernels optimized for
  audio processing workflows.

  The modular architecture already provides a good foundation for this migration
  since each component (feature extraction, clustering, sequencing) can be
  independently optimized for the hardware.
